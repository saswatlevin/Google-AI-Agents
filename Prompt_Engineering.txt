=======PROMPTING=======
It is the process of providing specific instructions to a GenAI tool to receive new information or to achieve a desired outcome on a task 
=======PROMPTING=======

There are 5 steps to designing a prompt: Task, Context, References, Evaluate, Iterate -> TCREI

A TASK prompt can be improved by adding a Persona to it.
We can also improve the structure of the output by specifying the structure.

==========CONTEXT===========
* Another thing that we can do is improve a prompt by adding CONTEXT to it. 
* CONTEXT is information related to the thing that we've asked for information about. 
* The more CONTEXT we can provide, the better.
==========CONTEXT===========

==========REFERENCES========
A reference is an example
==========REFERENCES========

AIs are always good at incorporating references (examples)

==========EVALUATE==========
This refers to evaluating, i.e., looking at the quality of the information output by the prompt.
==========EVALUATE==========

==========ITERATE===========
We must repeat the process, i.e., Define the Task, Add more Context, change References and Evaluate the information as needed.
==========ITERATE===========

The motto of the Google Course was "Always Be Iterating".

=========THE 4 ITERATION METHODS==========
1) Revisit the prompting framework -> Frame the TASK better, provide more CONTEXT, better REFERENCES or add a better PERSONA
2) Separate the prompt into shorter sentences and feed it to it very slowly
3) Try different phrasing or switch to an analogous task. Eg - Instead of asking it to write an essay about marketing, ask it to say how a product should fit into people's lives.
4) Introduce Constraints -> Put conditions / limits on the type of output you want

NOTE: The 4 iteration methods can be summarized by the following mnemonic -> Ramen Saves Tragic Is
